Programming Exercise: Address Book
---

This is a version of the Address Book programming exercise (original found [here](https://github.com/philidem/address-book-exercise))
that uses AngularJS to provide a rich client framework already configured to ease getting started.

## Dependencies
You will need the following things properly installed on your computer.

* [Git](http://git-scm.com/)
* [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) (with NPM)
* [Bower](http://bower.io/)
* [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/)

## Setup
1. Clone the repository and `cd` into it
2. Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

## Run the servers
The api and the client are run from two different web servers, each will need to be running from its own terminal process

```bash
npm run start-api
```

```bash
npm run start-client
```

## URL Endpoints
The api server runs by default on port 8080. It provides a data url at /api/people. This endpoint is proxied by the
client server so it can be referenced as if it were part of the same system.

The client server runs by default on port 4200. It proxies all requests to the api server.

**People Data:**
http://localhost:4200/api/people

## Goals
- Fork this repo
- Create a simple address book web application and use the given static
  HTML mockup (`mockup/index.html`) as a starting point or as inspiration.
- Your client application should fetch people data from the api source.
- It should render the names of all people from the people data in the left panel in alphabetical order.
- When a person's name is clicked in the left panel, render the full profile in the right panel.
- Update the `README.md` with any instructions for running the web application.
- When you are done, send a pull request with your changes.

### Bonus Points
- Add image URLs to the people data and render these photos in the profile
- Make it possible to change sort order of people shown in directory panel
- Expand on the flexibility of the people data and how its rendered to the user (be creative!)

### Additional Notes
- If you have any questions then [open an issue](https://github.com/michaelmcauley/address-book-exercise/issues)
- This version of the exercise is meant to be done with AngularJS, for a more open ended one see [here](https://github.com/philidem/address-book-exercise)
- Feel free to add any libraries to the client or server apps that you'd like to utilize.
- Feel free to modify `data/people.json` with any changes that you see fit.
- Feel free to add additional routes to the express app by modifying `api/app.js`
- Your address book does not need to use the exact same CSS or HTML as provided by the mockup.
